Molecules represent tokens of the language of chemistry, which underlies not only chemistry itself, but also scientific fields that use chemical information such as pharmacy, material science, and molecular biology. Existing molecular information is distributed across text books, publications, and patents. To describe structural information (spatial arrangement of atoms), molecules are commonly drawn as 2D images in such documents, which makes Optical Chemical Structure Understanding (OCSU) play an important role in molecule-centric scientific discovery.

Optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) is a well-explored task in the molecular information extraction field, which takes the image as input and predicts the SMILES representation of the molecule. Nevertheless, SMILES representation is machine readable strings, while it is not chemist-friendly. This hampers overall understanding of the optical chemical structure and hinders further application of cutting-edge natural language processing approaches, e.g. LLM, for moleculecentric scientific discovery. Our work expands low-level recognition to multilevel understanding and aims to translate chemical structure diagrams into readable strings for both machine and chemist.

OCSU aims to automatically translate chemical structure diagrams into chemist-readable or machine-readable strings that describe the molecule from motif level to molecule level and abstract level. Typically, it includes four subtasks, that is, functional group caption, molecular description, chemist-readable IUPAC naming, and machine-readable SMILES naming (OCSR). On the basis of these, molecular structural information can be fully extracted to support downstream tasks, such as moleculecentric chat, property prediction, and molecule editing.
